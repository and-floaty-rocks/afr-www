Since the last post, I've done some on-the-field research (ie: playing a lot of) platformer games - trying to get a sense of what kind of platformer I'd like to make. I've also done some rounds of asking colleagues about what they want to see with a co-op style platformer.

The [reference document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZusND7IiUbXNEzaaG19KvqY6gkFf3DKoY3pDogD4gY/edit#slide=id.p) I worked on last week was a good start for me at least to see what's around and popular. For every popular platform game, I'm sure there's dozens of failures - so trying to find the unique selling point (in product manager language) is something that this document tries to do. Instead of USP, I'll call it fun. I'm trying to find the fun in those games. I've obviously missed plenty of great platformers - N+, Fez, Braid, Trials Fusion, Prince of Persia, Abuse, Valiant Hearts, Velocity 2X, Galak Z, Metrico
Guacamelee, Mercenary Kings, Battleblock Theatre, IDARB, Mario Maker... this list could go on. Of course when you're researching and playing so much, there's a lot of scribbling on napkins, and ideas runnning through my head.

I've almost finish building my PC at home, and then can get started on putting together some streaming and recordings together. A great friend of mine is also doing the logo and it's coming along nicely, so overall I'm happy with the progress we're making.
