This week we had met to talk answer a few questions. We are currently two people working together and decisions made should be decided by both parties - especially since it is a project of passion. We both understand that the scope of the game needs to be small, and that we should try to aim to finish it within the first couple of months. Executing and completing is a priority for us. 

Knowing our own personal objectives, we decided to settle into making something with 2D. One particular genre that we both love are platformers, and decided this could be a good start for us.

We also looked into [love2d](https://love2d.org/), something that Nathan was familiar in and gives us the basics we need to get started.

In the meantime, we've compiled a list of great platformers we love and thinking about what kind of core gameplay we want to have. Stay tuned for more information!
