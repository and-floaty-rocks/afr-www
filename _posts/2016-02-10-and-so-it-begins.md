The year was 2012.  
Nathan and Eric were young and vestal then,  
and we were in love with games.  
It seemed to us that one day there would be a time,  
that we were going to make something.  

The year is 2016.  
We got older, and we had learnt more,  
we're still in love with games.  
That time is now, to make something,  
so here we are.
